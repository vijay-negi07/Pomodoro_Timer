# Pomodoro_Timer
This project is a Pomodoro Timer built using Python and the tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management strategy designed to enhance focus and efficiency by dividing work into structured sessions. Each session typically lasts 25 minutes, followed by a short break to maintain productivity and prevent fatigue. This timer automates the cycle of work and rest, helping users stay organized and maintain a balanced workflow.
